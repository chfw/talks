Evaluate the sample codes
--------------------------

To view the slides, you won't need to anything else. Github hosts it. However,
if you would like to run the example codes inside, please following these steps:

1. Make a virtual environment for yourself and activate it.
2. Then type `make`

Please note, by default it installs RISE, jupyter notebook slides. If you
do not wish to do so, please edit requirements.txt and Makefile.

You can copy-paste the examples into your editor and run it.
